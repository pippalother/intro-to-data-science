    "In this exercise, you will practice solving probability problems. Many of these will be math problems. You can write your answers in Markdown cells. Recall that you can use LaTeX to nicely format your math inside Markdown cellsby enclosing equations in single dollar signs (e.g., $x^2+4=8$) for inline math or double dollar signs for centered equations like $$P(X > 5) = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n",

    "For a reference if you are new to LaTeX, see the [overleaf documentation for mathematical expressions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/mathematical_expressions). Some particular LaTeX commands you might find useful include:\n",
    "- To write a fraction, use `\\frac{numerator}{denominator}` like $\\frac{3}{4}$\n",
    "- To write set intersection and union use `\\cap` and `\\cup` respectively like $A \\cap B$ and $A \\cup B$.\n",
    "- To write a bar over something (like a set complement) use `\\overline{}` like in $\\overline{E}$.\n",
    "- To write a subscript or superscript, use `_{}` or `^{}` as in $X_{n}$ or $X^{2}$.\n",
    "- To write a sum or product, use `\\sum` or `\\prod` as in $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ or $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.\n",
