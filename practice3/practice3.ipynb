Instead, represent the full system memory in the `System Memory MB` column, and get rid of the `System Memory GB` column. To do so, you need to convert the values in the GB column to MB (1 GB is 1000 MB) and add that to the MB column, then use the [`drop` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html) to remove the GB column.\n",

Filter the dataframe to the rows that are missing data for `active_ingredient`, then show those rows (if `my_view` is a dataframe view you have computed by filtering the data, you can simply put `my_view` as the last line of a cell and run it to get a tabular rendering of the rows in Jupyter). You may find the Pandas `isnull` method useful, you can see it's [documentation here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.isnull.html)."
